    "question": "IISc M.Mgt Program Information",
    "answer": "The Master of Management (M.Mgt) program at IISc is a two-year, full-time postgraduate program designed for graduate engineers, focusing on developing management skills in technology-intensive and data-driven organizations. The program objectives include enabling graduate engineers to grow into competent and creative managers of technology intensive and data driven organizations, encouraging entrepreneurship for high technology start-ups, and attracting and fostering doctoral students in management. Eligibility requires a four-year Bachelor's degree in Engineering/Technology or equivalent with a minimum of 60% marks or equivalent CGPA. Candidates with a Master's degree in Science or Commerce with Mathematics as a subject are also eligible. As of 2025, the program mainly accepts candidates with a 4-year STEM degree such as B.E., B.Tech, B.Arch, or B.Planning, and humanities degrees are currently not eligible. Most students have engineering backgrounds, but related STEM fields are also accepted. For the General category, the CAT/GATE percentile cutoff is approximately 98.8, with full category-wise cutoffs available in the official document at https://iisc.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cut-Off-Report-for-M.Mgt-Programme-2024.pdf. The course structure includes Hard Core Courses totaling 24 credits (8 courses × 3 credits each), Stream Core Courses totaling 12 credits (4 courses × 3 credits each), Electives totaling 12 credits, and Project work totaling 16 credits, for a total of 64 credits. Hard core courses include Introductory Probability Theory, Applied Statistics, Operations Management, Marketing Management, Behavioral Science, Managerial Economics, and Human Resource Management. The business analytics stream core courses cover Operations Research, Regression and Time Series Analysis, Data Mining, and Decision Models. Suggested electives include Macroeconomics, Linear and Non-linear programming, Deep Learning for NLP, Management of Technology for Sustainability, Entrepreneurship for Technology Start-ups, Random processes, Modeling and Simulation, Introduction to Scalable Systems, and Public Policy Theory & Process. The interviews typically focus on statistics and math topics such as probability, though depending on your background, questions can also cover economics, coding, or specific domain knowledge. Coding is not a strict prerequisite but helpful especially for CS backgrounds. The interview also includes a group discussion and a brief written summary exercise. Interview preparation should focus especially on basic math and probability, statistics, and coding if applicable, with preparation to discuss projects and previous work experience. Group discussion topics usually relate to general knowledge and communication skills. Work experience provides no formal advantage in scoring, but relevant experience may help during interviews. Standard documentation like payslips, ITRs, and employer letters are generally required to verify work experience. Gap years do not negatively impact admission or placement outcomes, and some of the highest salary offers have gone to candidates with gap years, provided they demonstrate strong performance. Most graduates are placed in data science, quantitative finance, AI research, and analytics roles, while product management and marketing roles are rare. Companies like Wells Fargo, JPMC, Uber, and Quantum Street AI are typical recruiters. M.Mgt students participate in IISc's central placement with M.Tech/MS students as well as departmental placements exclusive to the Department of Management Studies, providing broad access to recruiters from analytics, banking, tech, and research sectors. Nearly all students get placed historically, including those with gap years or diverse backgrounds. Placement statistics show an average CTC of approximately ₹27 LPA, median CTC of approximately ₹24 LPA, highest CTC of ₹35 LPA+, and typical in-hand salary of ₹20 LPA+. SIP pay is comparable to top analytics internships. Candidates from CSE/IT backgrounds or with prior SDE experience see offers above ₹30 LPA. The distribution is right-skewed due to high offers in quant/AI roles. PM roles are rare in IISc M.Mgt placements, but when they occur, companies value projects with tangible outcomes, leadership, internships, and strong communication. Certifications such as Scrum or Product Management can help but are not mandatory. Student life is described as chill and balanced, with classes held 4 days a week (Monday to Thursday) from 9:30 AM to 2 PM, and Fridays reserved for seminars. Students enjoy ample free time, modern sports facilities including football and cricket, single-room accommodation, and the beautiful IISc campus atmosphere. The library, night canteens, and extracurricular activities provide a vibrant campus experience. The summer term involves exposure to Public Sector as well as Private Sector R&D Organizations, and High-tech Industries in the Corporate Sector. Alternatively, exposure to Business Incubation, Venture Capital Funds, and Successful Start-Ups is encouraged.",
